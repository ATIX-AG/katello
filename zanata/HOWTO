OVERVIEW: 

katello po files are translated on the translate.engineering.redhat.com using the push/pull Zanata server. Maven is used to push po files to the server. Translators translate the strings and then Maven is used to pull down the translated strings and integrated back into the katello application.

SETUP: 

due to the internal host names in configuration files (zanata.xml), the zanata.xml and pom.xml files are containted in our internal git repo. place the zanata.xml and pom.xml in the katello locale directory. these are ignored by external katello git using gitignore file

also copy the sample config to your $HOME/.config dir. you will need to be a Katello Zanata maintainer and have a API key. 

you will need to import the ca cert for java. use the included shell script, import_cert.sh to pull this into the java keystore

to update the latest strings on the katello server run the following rake task:

rake gettext:find

the above command will update the pot and po files with latest string keys. commit this and then you can push to zanata for translation. 

once you have all the config files in place and have updated the po/pot files, you can push the pot files to zanata with following command: 

mvn zanata:publican-push (use only for new projects in zanata) 

If there are already some translated PO files use this one instead:

mvn zanata:publican-push -Dzanata.srcDir=.

Once the translation are completed you can pull them with:

mvn zanata:publican-pull

You will need to run rake gettext:pack after new po files are added back to Katello git repo.
