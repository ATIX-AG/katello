[development guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/DevProcess).
Also, make sure your code conforms to our style guidelines:

* [Ruby guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/RubyCodeConventions)
* [Javascript guidelines](https://github.com/Katello/katello.org/blob/master/docs/developer_guide/style/javascript.md)
* [Python guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/PythonCodeConventions)
